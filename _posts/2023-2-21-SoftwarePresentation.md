title: Software Development Process Presentation
---

Last week on february 15th I gave a presentation on Software Development processes. The presentation included Introductory topics and common terms, a generalized view of software development steps, and finally methodologies commonly used in software development teams. My presentation was given at the University of Iowa to a Machine Learning and Programming club to other students interested in Software Development. Attached is a download to the full presentation.

Thank you for your time and the read,
