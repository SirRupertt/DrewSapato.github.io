title: From Teen Coder to Business Builder: My Journey to Flourish Web Development
---

At just 14, I embarked on a coding adventure, inspired by family, teachers, and friends who urged me to keep creating and improving. I explored various fields: Software Development, Machine Learning and AI, even small indie game development. As this blog has chronicled this journey.

One pivotal moment occurred in college when my roommate mentioned using JavaScript for websites. Initially, I dismissed it, thinking it wasn't for me. But then, I stumbled upon stunning websites that were modern art pieces. It ignited a new mission in me: to create my own digital art through web development.

My early websites were  clunky, boring, and unremarkable. But I was determined. I studied the best in the industry, absorbing their talent and expertise. I realized that simply creating websites wasn't enough. My true calling was to help others succeed and grow through my work.

This led to the birth of Flourish Web Development. My core belief is that as I enhance my skills, the small businesses I work with will grow stronger and more resilient. Our growth is intertwined; their success is my success.

I am excited about the future, creating better websites, and meeting more inspiring business owners. Let's flourish together.

Thank you for your time and the read,
